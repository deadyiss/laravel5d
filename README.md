# Flagboard — CTF Competition Management Platform

Flagboard is a Capture The Flag (CTF) competition management web application built with **Laravel**, **Blade**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It is the final semester project for the *Object-Oriented Programming 2 (PBO2)* course, with a focus on designing and implementing **database table relationships** using Eloquent ORM.

## Features

- Create and manage CTF competitions with a start time, end time, and status
- Challenges grouped into six categories:
  Web, Cryptography, Forensics, Reverse Engineering, Pwn, and Miscellaneous
- Team system with invite codes; players join a team and compete together
- Team registration to competitions
- Flag submission per team; flags are stored as hashes, never in plain text
- Hints that cost points and can be unlocked per team
- Live scoreboard (points from solved challenges minus hint costs)
- Writeups written by players and linked to a challenge (draft or published)
- Tags for flexible challenge organization
- Role-based access: `admin` manages competitions and challenges, `player` participates

## Database Design

The full schema and every relationship are documented with Mermaid diagrams in
[`docs/database/erd.md`](docs/database/erd.md).

### Relationships Covered

| Type | Example |
|---|---|
| One-to-One | `User` ↔ `Profile` |
| One-to-Many | `Team` → `User`, `Competition` → `Challenge`, `Category` → `Challenge`, `Challenge` → `Hint`, `Challenge` → `Writeup`, `User` → `Writeup` |
| Many-to-Many | `Challenge` ↔ `Tag` (`challenge_tag`) |
| Many-to-Many with pivot data | `Team` ↔ `Competition` (`registered_at`), `Team` ↔ `Challenge` via `submissions` (`is_correct`, `submitted_at`), `Team` ↔ `Hint` via `hint_unlocks` (`unlocked_at`) |
| Has-Many-Through | `Competition` → `Submission` through `Challenge` |

### Business Rules

- A team can have only one correct submission per challenge.
- Flags are compared using hash verification (`Hash::check`) against `challenges.flag_hash`.
- Team score = sum of `points` of solved challenges − sum of `cost` of unlocked hints.
- A team can only submit to challenges of a competition it is registered in, while the competition status is `running`.

## Tech Stack

- PHP 8.3+ and Laravel
- Blade templates
- Tailwind CSS (via Vite)
- MySQL or SQLite

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/deadyiss/laravel5d.git

cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate

# Create the schema and seed the categories
php artisan migrate --seed

# Start the development servers
npm run dev
php artisan serve
```

Then open <http://localhost:8000>.
